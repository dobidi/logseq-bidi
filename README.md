# Logseq Bidirectional Text Plugin

![logseq-bidi](./images/logseq-bidi-promo-01-hd.jpg)

This plugin adds support for bidirectional text to Logseq graph. By activating
this plugin, regardless of the overall direction of the whole graph, the
content in any block gets rendered in the same direction associated with the
first strong character of that block. This helps to have graphs containing
RTL and LTR content.
